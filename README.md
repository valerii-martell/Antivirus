# Antivirus

Antivirus model developed by me during my internship at the Institute of Computer Technology

Detects in real-time malware such as virus signatures, code caves, and system DLL spoofing. 
Has a simulation of a remote real-time database of virus signatures (used EICAR signature as an example)

Technology stack used:
C#, C++, .NET Framework, WPF, Win32 API, MS-SQL (for system DLL unautorized changing), Firebase (to imitate some remote virus signature), encryption and decryption systems (MD5, SHA1)
